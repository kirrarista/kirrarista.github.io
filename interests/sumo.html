            <p>I once was looking for something random to watch at luch and it's been two years since I've stared following Grand Sumo. I obviously can't (and wouldn't be able to) practice sumo but following the life of the top division league has been a lot of fun.<p>
            <p>Below is a short FAQ with quick answers about sumo.</p>
